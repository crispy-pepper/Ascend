    "prot":[
        "A proton is a positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom.",
        "Together with neutrons, it makes up the bulk of an atom's mass.",
        "Fun Fact: Protons are so tiny that you could fit about 1,000,000,000 protons across the width of a human hair!"
    ],

    "neut":[
        "A proton is a neutrally charged (no net charge) subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom.",
        "Fun Fact: Neutrons are essential for the stability of most atoms. Without neutrons, atoms like hydrogen (which has no neutrons) would be incredibly unstable!"
    ],

    "elect":[
        "A proton is a negatively charged subatomic particle found orbiting on the outside of the nucleus",
        "They can switch atoms and shells!",
        "If you could somehow increase the size of an atom to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus (containing the protons and neutrons) would be the size of a tiny marble at the center, and the electrons would be whizzing around the stands!"
    ],

    "hydro":[
        "Hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the universe, consists of just one proton and one electron.",
        "Also, it could be called a proton!",
        "It's the most abundant element in the cosmos, making up around 75% Of all normal matter.",
        "Fun Fact: Hydrogen is the fuel that powers stars through nuclear fusion. When hydrogen atoms fuse together in the Sun, they form helium and release a huge amount of energy, which is why the Sun shines."
    ],

    "heli":[
        "Helium is the second simplest element in the periodic table, consisting of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons.",
        "Fun Fact: Helium is the second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It was formed in large quantities during the Big Bang."
    ],

    "lithi":[
        "Lithium is the third element on the periodic table, and it has three protons, three neutrons, and three electrons. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that is highly reactive, particularly with water.",
        "One of the first elements to be formed in the Big Bang, and there’s still a lot of it in the universe.",
        "Fun Fact: Lithium is used in rechargeable batteries for phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Due to its mood-stabilizing properties, it’s also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder."
    ],

    "bery":[
        "Beryllium is the fourth element on the periodic table, with four protons, four neutrons, and four electrons",
        "Fun Fact: The gemstone emerald is a type of beryllium mineral, and beryllium is also found in aquamarine and other gemstones"

    ],

    "atom1":[
        "As we increase the # of protons in the nucleus, heavier elements are formed in stars through nuclear fusion.",
        "These elements are formed in the cores of stars through nuclear reactions involving lighter elements like hydrogen and helium.",
        "The death of massive stars in supernovae (explosions) scatters these heavier elements into space, enriching the universe with the materials needed to form planets, life, and everything we see around us.",
        "Fun Fact: Every element heavier than lithium was created in stars—some in normal stars, others in supernova explosions, and some in the mergers of neutron stars. We are literally made of stardust!",
        "Fun Fact: The process of forming heavier elements from lighter ones is called nucleosynthesis. Most of the elements we’re made of, like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, were formed in stars that lived and died long before the Sun was born."
    ],  

    "star":[
        "Stars are massive balls of hot, glowing gas, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium."
        "Stars produce energy through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy."
        "The brightness of a star depends on its size, temperature, and distance from Earth. This is measured using its luminosity and apparent magnitude."
        "Stars go through life cycles: they are born in nebulae, live for millions to billions of years, and die in spectacular ways (e.g., as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes)."
        "Our Sun is a medium-sized star, and it’s about halfway through its 10-billion-year lifespan!"
        "The color of a star indicates its temperature. Blue stars are the hottest, while red stars are cooler."
    ], 

    "galaxy":[
        "A galaxy is a vast collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity."
        "The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, and it’s just one of billions in the universe."
        "Galaxies come in various shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy."
        "The size of a galaxy can range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of light-years across."
        "Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is estimated to contain 100 to 400 billion stars!"
        "Galaxies are often found in groups called galaxy clusters. Our Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which includes over 50 galaxies."
    ],

    "nebula":[
        "A nebula is a vast cloud of gas and dust in space, often the birthplace of stars."
        "Nebulae come in different types: emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and dark nebulae, each with unique characteristics."
        "Emission nebulae, like the Orion Nebula, glow brightly due to ionized gases (mainly hydrogen) being excited by radiation from nearby young, hot stars."
        "Reflection nebulae don't emit light but instead reflect the light of nearby stars, often giving them a blue hue due to the scattering of light."
        "Dark nebulae are dense clouds of dust and gas that block light from stars or other nebulae behind them, creating regions of darkness in the sky."
        "Nebulae are the factories where new stars are born. The intense heat and pressure inside these clouds cause gas and dust to collapse and form new stars."
        "Some nebulae are the remnants of dying stars, like the Crab Nebula, which is the remnant of a supernova explosion."
        "The material in nebulae can also create planets, moons, and other objects as it condenses into dense regions."
