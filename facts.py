    "prot":[
        "A proton is a positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom.",
        "Together with neutrons, it makes up the bulk of an atom's mass.",
        "Fun Fact: Protons are so tiny that you could fit about 1,000,000,000 protons across the width of a human hair!"
    ],

    "neut":[
        "A proton is a neutrally charged (no net charge) subatomic particle found in the nucleus of every atom.",
        "Fun Fact: Neutrons are essential for the stability of most atoms. Without neutrons, atoms like hydrogen (which has no neutrons) would be incredibly unstable!"
    ],

    "elect":[
        "A proton is a negatively charged subatomic particle found orbiting on the outside of the nucleus",
        "They can switch atoms and shells!",
        "If you could somehow increase the size of an atom to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus (containing the protons and neutrons) would be the size of a tiny marble at the center, and the electrons would be whizzing around the stands!"
    ],

    "hydro":[
        "Hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the universe, consists of just one proton and one electron.",
        "Also, it could be called a proton!",
        "It's the most abundant element in the cosmos, making up around 75% Of all normal matter.",
        "Fun Fact: Hydrogen is the fuel that powers stars through nuclear fusion. When hydrogen atoms fuse together in the Sun, they form helium and release a huge amount of energy, which is why the Sun shines."
    ],

    "heli":[
        "Helium is the second simplest element in the periodic table, consisting of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons.",
        "Fun Fact: Helium is the second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It was formed in large quantities during the Big Bang."
    ],

    "lithi":[
        "Lithium is the third element on the periodic table, and it has three protons, three neutrons, and three electrons. It is a soft, silvery-white metal that is highly reactive, particularly with water.",
        "One of the first elements to be formed in the Big Bang, and there’s still a lot of it in the universe.",
        "Fun Fact: Lithium is used in rechargeable batteries for phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Due to its mood-stabilizing properties, it’s also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder."
    ],

    "bery":[
        "Beryllium is the fourth element on the periodic table, with four protons, four neutrons, and four electrons",
        "Fun Fact: The gemstone emerald is a type of beryllium mineral, and beryllium is also found in aquamarine and other gemstones"

    ],

    "atom1":[
        "As we increase the # of protons in the nucleus, heavier elements are formed in stars through nuclear fusion.",
        "These elements are formed in the cores of stars through nuclear reactions involving lighter elements like hydrogen and helium.",
        "The death of massive stars in supernovae (explosions) scatters these heavier elements into space, enriching the universe with the materials needed to form planets, life, and everything we see around us.",
        "Fun Fact: Every element heavier than lithium was created in stars—some in normal stars, others in supernova explosions, and some in the mergers of neutron stars. We are literally made of stardust!",
        "Fun Fact: The process of forming heavier elements from lighter ones is called nucleosynthesis. Most of the elements we’re made of, like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, were formed in stars that lived and died long before the Sun was born."
